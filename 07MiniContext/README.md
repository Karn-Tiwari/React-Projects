# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. First create a folder name is context and in which create a file name UserContext.js and in that file.
2. First create a variable name UserContext from React.createContext()
3. And after than by this UserContext variable we just wrap all the component in which we want to send the props and after wrapping it UserContext.provider behaves like Global variable in which what are the props needed to all the component are available in UserContext variable.
4. Create a file UserContextProvider.jsx in that create a method UserContextProvider
5.
